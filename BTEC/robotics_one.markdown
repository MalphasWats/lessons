## Learning Objectives

* A2: Pattern Recognition, Identify common elements in a system
* A4: Algorithm Design, Describing a step-by-step solution to a problem
* B1: Pseudocode, Producing pseudocode

## Success Criteria

| Level | Criteria |
|=======|==========|
| Pass  | Simple sequence of instructions to effect movement in a robot |
| Merit | Sequence of instructions to produce co-ordinated movement in a robot |
| Distinction | Functions defined for different classes of movement in a robot |

## Pattern Recognition

Start by observing the reference robot. Identify the sequence that the legs move in.

## Algorithm Design

Write a simple pseudocode algorithm to define the walking sequence - make your *best guess* for the angles the servos are moving within.

## Dancing

Once you're confident you know how to make your robot move, you need to get a feel for how much each servo needs to move.

Start by creating a simple looping program that makes the robot dance from side to side, by moving just the **front servo**.

Use the [Microsoft PXT Editor](http://microbit.org/code/) to write your program in *block mode*.

## Walking

Now you know how much each servo needs to move - implement your full algorithm and make your robot move.

## Roaming

Write a program that uses functions to make the robot walk in a pattern, turning to the left and right.
