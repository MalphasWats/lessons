| 5 | I can describe the story of a game in terms of defining genre features
| 6 | I can describe a set of game objectives in terms of an overall story, with reference to defining genre features.


## Designing a Game Concept

Pick a genre from:

1. Platform
2. Adventure
3. RPG

Begin by describing that genre in terms of key defining features. You should already have this from your previous piece of work.

### Story

Write the MAIN STORY LINE of your game. You should introduce characters, consider their motivation - why are they doing what they are doing? Introduce the setting, explain what is happening there.

You will need to produce a story board later too.

### Objectives

Next you must identify the *Primary Objective* of the game along with at least **5 other 'sub-objectives'** that the player must complete.

When identifying objectives, be sure to explain any special items they must collect in order to complete them, any other special conditions, puzzles that might need to be solved, boss monsters defeated and so on.
