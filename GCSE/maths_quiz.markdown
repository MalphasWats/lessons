* Design a solution to a given problem
* Implement a solution

## Success Criteria

| Grade | Description |
|=======|=============|
| D | Create a flowchart that roughly describes the solution to a given problem |
|   | Write a python program that implements some of the requirements |
| C | Create a flowchart that describes a solution |
|   | Write a python program that implements the requirements |
| B - A | Produce a design & solution that takes into account special cases and user input |

## System Requirements

A primary school teacher wants a computer program to test the basic arithmetic skills of her students. The program should generate a quiz consisting of a series of random questions, using in each case any two numbers and addition, subtraction and multiplication. The system should ask the studentâ€™s name, then ask 10 questions, output if the answer to each question is correct or not and produce a final score out of 10.

## Systems Analysis

Start by analysing the requirements - break it down into steps.

**Produce a flow chart to describe this system**

## Systems Development

Now you need to implement your solution. Take it one step at a time.

First, let's ask the user for their name:

```
student_name = input("Please enter your name: ")
```

Once this code has been executed, the *variable* `student_name` will contain whatever the user typed in.

Now let's generate a simple question, display it to the user and ask them for an answer:

```
student_name = input("Please enter your name: ")

num1 = 1
num2 = 1

answer = num1 + num2

print("What is %s + %s" % (num1, num2))
student_answer = input("? : ")
```
