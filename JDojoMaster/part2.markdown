## A Sprite of Our Own

Purple [rectangles aren't very interesting][THOMAS], let's make a sprite. Our sprites are going to be 32pixels x 32pixels. You need to make a little fighting person. Here's one I made:

<img src="src/sprite.png" alt="Karate Dude">

You can use this one if you like (right-click and save the image), or create your own. [Piskel App][PISKEL] is a great online pixel editor. Be sure to export it as a `.png` file when you're done making your character. Export controls are over in the little menu bar on the right, look for the button with the little mountains on it.

Alright,
