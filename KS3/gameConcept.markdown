title: Computer Game Concept
---

## Introduction

In this project you will be creating a *concept* for a new computer game.

## Investigation

Before you can create your own concept, you must look at what came before.

You need to:

1. investigate how digital games and game platforms have evolved over time
2. compare the capabilities and limitations of different gaming platforms
3. investigate the characteristics of digital games across different genres
4. explain the game objectives from different digital games.

You will present your findings in a written report.

### Evolution of Platforms

For this task you will be looking at the gaming platforms that *Nintendo* have developed over the last 30 years.

Starting with the Nintendo Entertainment System (1985) and following each release up to the Switch (2017) you need to identify and *evaluate* the following features:

- Release Date
- Price
- Capabilities (Graphics, sound, controllers, multiplayer, network)
- Example screenshots of games

One of the interesting things about the Nintendo eco-system is that they have released similar games on each platform over the course of 30 years, showing a really clear progression of the capabilities of each of their systems.

#### Push yourself

Do the same for the *Sega Master System* and *Sega Megadrive* - which Nintendo systems did these compete with? What were the key differences?

### Comparing Modern Systems

In a similar vein to the previous task, you will be comparing gaming systems, but this time, you'll be looking at the systems available today from different manufacturers.

You need to compare the **capabilities** and **limitations** of:

1. Microsoft Xbox One
2. Sony PlayStation 4
3. Nintendo Switch

#### Push yourself

  Take it further - can you identify 2 more modern gaming platforms? What are their capabilities and limitations.
