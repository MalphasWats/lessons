## Introduction

People use computer models to help them make decisions. Data must be collected and analysed with special algorithms in order to help them make better decisions about a wide range of things - from how many people they can afford to invite to a wedding to how many homes can be supplied by a new power station through to how global warming is affecting the hunting of Polar Bears.

## Cakes

The model we will be looking at has been set up to help the owner of a small bakery make decisions about her business.

Start by downloading the file below and opening it using Microsoft Excel.

[Bakery Spreadsheet](resources/cakes.xlsx)

## Sales

In the image below you will find the sales figures for cakes sold in a given week.

Enter the values into the empty columns in the `Dashboard` worksheet.

Once you have entered the values, take a look at the `Profit` box - how much money will be made at the end of the month given these sales numbers?

## Profit

Currently, the shop is not making any money - rent, business rates and wages cost more than the shop made by selling cakes.

Use the model to identify which cakes are making the least amount of profit.

What could you do to try and make more money next month - assume for now that Sales figures won't change!

For a small business such as this, aim at first to **break even**. That means make zero, or a small positive profit.

## What if?

The cake shop model is quite sophisticated and can be used to answer a number of interesting 'What if?' questions. Business owners can use models like this to plan for the future and ensure that their business stays healthy.

1. *What if* an outbreak of foot and mouth causes the price of butter and cream to double? What's happening with the Vanilla Cheesecake?!
2. *What if* employees are given a 10% raise?
3. *What if* the landlord raises the rent by 25%?

What other questions do you think you might be able to ask? How might this model help you to answer them?
