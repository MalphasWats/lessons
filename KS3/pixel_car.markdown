title: Pixel Art Racing Car
---

We're going to be making a simple racing game so we need to create some *assets* for the game.

*Assets* are images, sounds, animations, videos and other digital resources that are used in creating media products. In this case, we need to make a racing car and some other features of a race track (the actual racetrack itself we'll do separately later on).

We're going create our racing car using the **Pixel Art** style. Pixel art is all about precisely setting individual pixels in an image - pixels are the tiny dots that make up all images, the smallest squares of colour that our monitors can display.

Our game will be *Top Down*, this means we'll be viewing it from above, or in bird's eye view.

## Tools

We're going to use [Piskel App](http://www.piskelapp.com) to create our car and track features.

After you click on the link, click the "Create Sprite" button.

Take a look at the examples below - notice how the overall shape of the car has been set out using a dark outline which has then been coloured in. Shading has then been used to give the car some depth.

When it's time to save. Click the save button and choose "save as .piskel"
