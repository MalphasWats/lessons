## Introduction

A storyboard is a planning tool for creating visual stories.

## Examples

Take a look at these two examples of storyboards:

1. [Alice in Wonderland Trainers](resources/alice_storyboard.jpg)
2. [Cake Mixing Machine Instructions](resources/machine_storyboard.jpg)

As you can see from these two examples, storyboards can be used for a variety of different purposes - planning for a television advert and instructions for how to operate a machine.

## Tetris

Your task is to create a storyboard for the game tetris.

Take a look at the video below. You need to draw a storyboard that captures each part of the game 'story'. Consider:

1. How the game starts out
2. What happens when blocks start falling
3. What happens when lines are made?
4. When does the game end?
5. What happens if you achieve a **super high score**?

Use PowerPoint to create a storyboard - each slide is a single 'frame'. Be sure to include the 'HUD' area where the score, level, lines and next block are displayed.
