## Learning Objectives

* How to enter & format data in a spreadsheet
* The purpose of Data Validation
* How to perform simple calculations
* How to use VLOOKUP functions for more complex calculations

## The Zoo

For this project, you will be producing a spreadsheet to help manage the finances of a new zoo that is opening.

Your first task is to invent a name for your Zoo!

Open Microsoft Excel and create a `Blank Workbook`. Type the name of your zoo into `Cell A1`.

At the bottom of the spreadsheet, you should see a tab: `Sheet 1`

* Double click the tab and rename it to **Decisions**. 
* Click the little *circle-with-a-plus* button to create a new sheet.
* Rename the new sheet to **Animals**.
* Click the little *circle-with-a-plus* button to create *another* new sheet.
* Rename this new sheet to **Pay Grades**.

At this point, you should *save your spreadsheet*. Save it in your `computing` folder, and name it `Zoo`.

## The Animals

Once you have saved your spreadsheet, the first sheet to fill in should be the *Animals* sheet. Click on the tab to select the sheet, add an appropriate title in `Cell A1`.

The zoo will be keeping 10 animals initially. They are:

| Animal | Grade | Animal Bonus |
|========|=======|=====|
|Capybara|   1   |  |
|Gorilla |   5   |  |
| Wolf   |   3   |  |
| Lion   |   5   |  |
| Honey Badger | 2 | |
| Elephant | 4   | |
| Rhino   |  4   | |
| Python  |  2   | |
| Red River Hog | 3 | |
| Spider Monkey | 3 | |

Enter the details above into your *Animals* sheet. Use borders, background and text colours to make it easy to follow.

## Pay Grades

Animals are looked after by *Keepers*. Keepers come with varying ranges of experience which command different levels of pay. The zoo will be setting up 5 pay grades as follows:

| Grade | Base Salary |
|=======|=============|
|   1   | 18000 |
|   2   | 20000 |
|   3   | 25000 |
|   4   | 32000 |
|   5   | 40000 |

Enter this information, along with suitable titles, headings and formatting, into the *Pay Grades* sheet in your spreadsheet.

## Staff

After an initial recruitment drive, the zoo has employed the following keepers

| Staff Member | Grade | Animal | Grade Required | Salary |
|==============|=======|========|================|========|
| Jedidah      |   3   | | | |
| Adam         |   4   | | | |
| Harrison     |   5   | | | |
| Jack         |   1   | | | |
| Lauren       |   4   | | | |
| Olivia       |   5   | | | |
| George       |   2   | | | |
| Morgan       |   2   | | | |
| Kian         |   3   | | | |
| Aiden        |   4   | | | |
| Kieran       |   3   | | | |
| Sarah        |   4   | | | |
| Kelly        |   5   | | | |
| Alex         |   3   | | | |

Enter this information into the **Decisions** sheet, again using appropriate titles, headings & formatting.

## Data Validation

The first step is to assign an appropriate animal to each keeper. We could just type in the name for each animal, but we want to make sure there are no mistakes like spelling the animal name wrong, or assigning an animal that the zoo isn't going to keep! 

This is called **Data Validation** - making sure that data entered is *valid* or *usable* by our spreadsheet.
