Choose a transactional website that you are familiar with, 
one that sells products (avoid sites like ebay or amazon). 

Your report will need to include:

* the purpose of the site and how successfully it meets this objective
* how it is structured
* the goods and/or services it offers
* the product information provided
* types of transactions that can be made and how easy it is to do so
* methods used to capture customer information (both overt and covert)
and authenticate the identity of customers
* techniques used to engage, retain and entice customers
* its usability and accessibility
* the 'customer experience' it offers.

**You must include screenshots to illustrate each section.**
