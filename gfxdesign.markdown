## Learning Objective

* Develop general *Fireworks* design skills
* Using the 'Bezier' pen tool
* Applying colour gradients
* Arranging objects in a scene

## Islands

To start with, you'll need to open up Fireworks and create a new canvas.

When you start Fireworks for the first time, you will see something like this:

Choose *Fireworks Document* under the "Create New" heading, make your new document about **700px x 600px**:

You'll be following the steps in the videos below, but first, you need to copy and paste the source image we'll be working with:

## Part 1

Now follow the video below. Feel free to pause and watch sections multiple times until you're confident what you need to do.

Now that you've got an idea of how basic shapes can be used to create complex objects it's your turn to have a go. Try creating some luxury huts for people to live in on the islands, or perhaps some ancient ruins. Maybe you could make a tour boat with little tourists on board taking photos of your island creations. *Use your imagination*.
