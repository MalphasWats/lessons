## Learning Objectives

* Use Adobe Fireworks to create a simple logo
* Using the Text Tool
* Using the Shape tool

## Getting Started

We're going to look at how to use Adobe Fireworks to create a simple logo for a computer game. This project can also be [downloaded as a pdf](resources/Graphic Design - Creating a Logo.pdf)

When you open up Fireworks for the first time, it will look a little like this:

![Adobe Fireworks](resources/01_FireworksWelcome.png)

Under the “Create New” heading, choose “Fireworks Document (PNG)”.
Once you have done that, a new window should open up to ask you for some dimensions. It doesn't matter too much what size you make your canvas, but it's a good idea to keep it small at this stage, as that makes it easy to work with. I've started with 500 pixels square:

![500px canvas](resources/02_CanvasSize.png)

Make sure all of the other settings are the same and click `OK` when you're ready.

Before we get started, we need to set up our workspace by rearranging some of the tabs on the right-hand-side. Start by double-clicking the tabs named `Optimize` and `Styles`. This causes them to collapse, making more room for the middle section.
In the middle section, click once on the `Layers` tab to select that one.

Now that we're set up, the next task is to find a background image for our logo. Using the internet, find an image that you think represents your chosen genre & title. I'm choosing a puzzle game with the name *Mindbreaker*, so searched for a *puzzly* type image and found a nice purple hexagon image to use.

![Hexagon Background](resources/04_HexBackground.png)

Once you have found an image you like, you need to save it in your project folder (don't copy-and-paste it, it can cause problems). You should be able to right-click the image in your browser and choose “Save picture as…”.

### Importing the background
Once you have a background saved, go back into Fireworks and choose `Import…` from the `File` menu.

![file - import](resources/05_FileImport.png)

Navigate to the image you saved from the internet and choose it. Click `OK`.

At this stage, nothing happens, but if you look closely, when your mouse is over the canvas it has changed to a right-angle bracket. Click anywhere on the canvas to place the image you've chosen.

If your image is very large, it might be helpful to resize it. You can do this quickly by right-clicking on the image and choosing `Transform > Numeric Transform`:

![Numeric Transform](resources/07_NumericTransform.png)
 
A new window will appear that asks how you want to resize. It depends on the size of your image, mine was quite large so I reduced it to 50% of its original size:

![Numeric Transform](resources/08_NumericTransform.png)

This left the image still bigger than the canvas, but that's ok. Click “OK”.
Next we want to move the background image around on the canvas so it covers it all and shows an interesting part of the image. Depending on the size of the image you chose, you might need to make it a little bigger or smaller again. Experiment and see what you can get.
Once I'd moved mine around, I had this:

![Background set](resources/09_BackgroundSet.png)

The last thing to do before we move on is to lock the background layer. If we don't lock it, we'll keep accidently selecting the background image and moving it around which can be quite annoying. By locking the layer, we can stop this from happening.
In the layers panel on the right, click the little empty box next to the eye:

![Lock Layer](resources/10_LockLayer.png)
 
You should get a little padlock appear, which means that the layer is locked and can't be edited any more.

### Adding Text

As this point, it's probably a good idea to save what you have done so far. From the `File` menu, choose `Save`. Remember to save it in your project folder and give it a useful name like `Logo.png`.

The next step is to use the text tool to add a single initial to the canvas. In my case, because I'm creating a logo for "Mindbreaker", I'm going to add the letter "m".

![Placing Text](resources/11_PlacingText.png)

With the Text Tool selected, click anywhere on the canvas and type the first letter of your game's name.

At the bottom of the screen is the `Properties` pane. This changes with the settings for each of the tools we use. When the text tool is in use, we can <span style="color:#3399FF">choose a font</span>, <span style="color:#33CC00">size</span> and <span style="color:#FF9900">colour</span>.

Picking a font is an important design decision. Take your time and try out some different ones. Try to think what fits best to your type of game.

Ideally, you should choose either **white** or **black** for the colour, depending on the colour of your background. For light backgrounds, choose black, if it's a dark background choose black.

Once you have something you're happy with, you need to move it into the middle of the canvas. 

Choose the `Black Arrow` selection tool. <img class="inline" src="resources/ 12_BlackArrow.png" alt="Black Arrow"> If you click and drag the letter you added to the canvas, you might notice that you get some guides popping up as you move it around:

![Centre Guides](resources/13_CentreGuides.png)

These guides help you to like objects up either with each other, or with the canvas. Use the guides you help you get the letter in the middle.
Next, use the Text Tool again to add the full name of the game, place it underneath the first initial that you already added.

![Game Title](resources/14_PlacingText.png)

You should use the same font, but you will probably want to make the full name quite a bit smaller than the initial letter.

Use the guides again to get it central, but leave a big gap between the name and the initial.

This is another good point to save your work. Choose `File > Save`.

### Drawing a Box

Next we're going to draw a box around the initial letter. Choose the Rectangle Tool and draw a box around the initial.

![Rectangle Tool](resources/15_DrawingRect.png)

When you're drawing the box, hold down the Shift-key on your keyboard to force the shape to stay square.
Default settings of the rectangle tool draw a filled in rectangle, which we don't want. Change the <span style="color:#3399FF">Fill Colour</span> to transparent:

![Colour Picker](resources/16_ColourPickerTransparent.png)

For the <span style="color:#33CC33">Outline Colour</span>, choose the same colour you used for your text (I used white):

![Rectangle Border](resources/17_RectangleBorder.png)

Next, change the <span style="color:#FFFF00">Border Thickness</span> – you'll need to experiment here to find what works best. You want to try and match the thickness of the letters in the name.
You can also change the <span style="color:#6600CC">Line Type</span> to `Basic > Hard Line` to get sharp corners on your box.
It's worth pointing out at this stage that you don't have to draw a rectangle. If you click-and-hold the rectangle tool, you get more options:

![Shape Tools](resources/18_ShapeTools.png)

You could use any of the built-shapes. Try them out and see which one works best for your game idea.

At this point you're finished. This basic guide shows you how to quickly make an effective logo for all kinds of different products.

Why not try making another logo for something completely different – some new trainers, or a scooter. When you're doing it for objects, instead of putting the initial of the name in the box, why not draw a simple icon that represents the object:
