## Awww, look at the cute little... erm... what is that again?

We're going to design our little creature now - what hatches from your egg? Try to be as imaginative as you can, make this creature your best pixel art to date.

Start with a **16x16 pixel** canvas in Fireworks and draw out your creature, then enlarge it again and *save it as a .gif file.* Just like you did for the egg.

Once you have your creature, you need to create 2 more frames that define a simple 'idle' animation. You could make it blink, breathe, shuffle its feet or claws or tentacles or whatever appendages it has. Again, be creative.

When you're done, you should have 4 .gif files:

1. egg.gif
2. creature.gif
3. idle_frame_1.gif
4. idle_frame_2.gif

![egg.gif](resources/egg.gif) ![creature.gif](resources/creature.gif) ![idle_frame_1.gif](resources/idle_frame_1.gif) ![idle_frame_2.gif](resources/idle_frame_2.gif)

If you don't call them that, don't expect the next bits of code to work without substituting my names for yours.
