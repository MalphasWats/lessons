## Learning Objective

* Developing pixel art with Fireworks
* Managing a project
* Stop Motion animation techniques

## Getting Set Up

We're going to be creating some simple Pixel Art characters using Adobe Fireworks.

Start up the program and create a new document 96px x 96px.

We're going to be creating a character just 16 pixels square - keeping it small keeps it simple and *should* make it easier to create something that looks good.

Before we start, we need to set up a grid guide to make sure we draw things at the right size. From the `View > Grid` menu, choose `Show Grid`:

Then again in `View > Grid`, choose `Edit Grid...`:

Set the grid to 16px by 16px and it often helps to choose a colour that's easier to see. Click `OK`. You should be able to see a grid overlaid on the canvas. Since we're working with such a small canvas, it's probably helpful to zoom in a bit. Hold down the `ctrl` key and press `0` (zero). That makes Fireworks zoom in so that the canvas fills all the space you have for it:

We actually only want to draw in one of these boxes or *frames*  at a time, so using the `Magnifying Glass` tool, draw a box around the top-left *frame* to zoom right in:

Now the canvas should be zoomed right into one frame and you're ready to start drawing a character. When you're drawing Pixel Art, you need to make sure that you only use the `Pencil Tool`:

## Fairytale with a twist

For this project, you should be working in groups of 2 or 3. You need to start off choosing a fairytale or story that you want to create. In the video above, I used *Humpty Dumpty*, and added the simple twist that he fell out of the computer, instead of off a wall!

Once you have your idea sorted, you need to draw your character. **Each member of the group needs to create their own character**. You'll need to create different frames - in my example you can see I've created different frames for Humpty blinking. You might want to create walking frames or picking things up - think about the story you want to tell!

Once you have your character, you need to resize it and print it out:

Before we resize it, we need to change a setting in Fireworks. First up, choose `Edit > Preferences...` in the menu:

![Adobe Fireworks](resources/03-nearest-neighbour.png)

In the preferences window, choose *'Nearest Neighbour'* from the *'Interpolation'* drop-down. This will make sure that when we resize what we've drawn, it will still look good. Look at the image below - the egg on the left has been resized using the "Nearest Neighbour" setting, the egg on the right has been resized using the default "Bicubic" setting.

Now we can resize. Hold down the `Ctrl` key and press `A`. Everything you've drawn should be selected:

![Adobe Fireworks](resources/10-select-all.png)

Next, from the `Modify > Transform` menu, choose `Numeric Transform`:

![Adobe Fireworks](resources/11-numeric-transform-menu.png)

We want to enlarge what we've drawn about 8 times, so make sure that `Scale` is selected in the dropdown box and put 800 into both boxes:

![Adobe Fireworks](resources/12-numeric-transform-scale-8x.png)

Click ok and you should *just about* be able to see that everything got bigger:

![Adobe Fireworks](resources/13-resized.png)

Fireworks doesn't change the size of the canvas for us, so we need to do it. Deselect everything that selected, either by clicking anywhere away from the blue boxes, or by holding down `Ctrl` and pressing `D`:

![Adobe Fireworks](resources/14-deselect-all.png)

Down in the `Properties` pane at the bottom of the screen, there should now be a button that says `Fit Canvas`. Click it and Fireworks will resize the canvas to fit everything on it:

![Adobe Fireworks](resources/15-resized-fit-canvas.png)

Now you can print your character sheet and cut out all of the character frames! Consider also that you might need to create some scenery or other objects for your story!
